nstallation
============

On UNIX-like systems (including Linux, Mac OS X, MinGW), use the 
autotools based build system. Run the following commands from the top 
directory (containing this file) to configure, build and install the 
library and utilities:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

If you downloaded the libdivecomputer source code directly from the git
source code repository, then you need to create the configure script as
the first step:

  $ autoreconf --install

To uninstall libdivecomputer again, run:

  $ make uninstall
